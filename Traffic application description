This program demonstrates a simplified quantum routine related to the Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, where quantum circuits are used to enhance sampling and 
probability estimation tasks that are traditionally done with classical Monte Carlo simulations. In classical Monte Carlo, random sampling is used to approximate 
integrals, model stochastic processes, or simulate physical systems, but the convergence rate is limited by statistical noise. Quantum Monte Carlo leverages quantum 
superposition and entanglement to prepare complex probability distributions more efficiently and uses the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) — as implemented here — to 
transform the quantum state into a basis where the desired quantities can be extracted with fewer samples. In this example, Hadamard and controlled-Z gates prepare a 
non-trivial initial state, the QFT maps it into the frequency domain, and repeated measurements generate a distribution of bitstrings that represents quantum samples 
from this transformed space. While this demonstration is abstract, similar techniques are applied in real-world QMC problems such as quantum chemistry for estimating
molecular energies, financial modeling for option pricing, and statistical physics for simulating many-body systems, often achieving a quadratic speedup over their classical counterparts.
